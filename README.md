## About the Game
**Magic Concentration Game** is a fun and interactive memory game. A player flips over *magical* cards to find matching *magical* pairs. The player has **7 rounds** to match **all pairs** before they run out of turns.

## Why This Game?
Concentration was one of my favorite games growing up. I wanted to create and visually appealing game that stretches your memory muscles. I decided to make it a magical theme for a *whimsical* feel.
